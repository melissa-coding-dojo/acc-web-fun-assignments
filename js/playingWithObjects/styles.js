// Objectives
// Practice iterating through an array of objects/dictionaries.
// How would you print/log John's age?
// How would you print/log the name of the first object?
// How would you print/log the name and age of each user using a for loop?  Your output should look something like this

var users = [
    {
        name: "Michael",
        age: 37
    },
    {
        name: "John",
        age: 30
    },
    {
        name: "David",
        age: 27
    }
];
